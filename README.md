# UCSB Physics ILG Ball Drop Lab
**DOCUMENTATION WORK IN PROGRESS (W.I.P)**

This contains information regarding the Physics 7L lab measuring acceleration due to gravity using various instruments. 
What can be found here is the complete documentation of the digital measuring system used at the end of the lab. 
**User instruction guide, setup guide, hardware CAD, firmware, PCBs, and assembly can be found here.**

# How to use the ball drop measuring system:

## Componets
- **Control Unit**: 
- **Photogate**:
- **Magnet**: 
- **Power Supply**: 9V 5.5mm Barrel Jack Power Supply Rated for > 500mA
- **Steel Ball** 
## Powering it on
Before plugging in the system it is important to make sure the **photogate** and the **magnet** are properly plugged in using the corresponding color coded cables coming out of the **control unit**. The unit will not work if this is not done before powering it on.

Ensure a **9v** power supply is plugged into the Control Unit's power port located on the top right of the housing. The unit takes around 5-10 seconds to fully power on. A display message appears on the screen when the device is booted.
## Set Ready
To arm the magnet, press the red button once. The red indicator light will turn off, and the green light will be illuminated, indicating the magnet is magnetized and the device is ready to begin the recording. The OLED screen will also display a "Ready4Drop" message.
At this point the steel ball is ready to be loaded into slot on the magnet assembly.
## Measure
Press the green button! The magnet will de-energize and the release the steel ball. 
## Reading the Data
The time in ms. will print out to the OLED display on the top of the unit
